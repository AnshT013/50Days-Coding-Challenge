# 💻 50 Days Coding Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my journey of discipline, consistency, and growth through the **#50DaysCodingChallenge** — inspired by the **#DrGViswanathanChallenge** at VIT Bhopal.

---

## 📅 Challenge Overview

- **Duration:** 50 Days  
- **Start Date:** 30/04/2025  
- **End Date:** 18/06/2025  
- **Goal:** Practice and improve skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Math-based problem solving by solving two LeetCode problems daily.

---

## 👨‍💻 Daily Structure

Each day includes:  
- ✅ 1 DSA Problem  
- ✅ 1 Math-based Problem  

📝 Problems are solved individually and discussed in groups — because collaboration accelerates learning.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Mathematics & Number Theory  
- And more...
